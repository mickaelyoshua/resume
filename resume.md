Hi, my name is Mickael Yoshua Cardoso Reis. I've been loving work with data science since I started my Intership at Court of Auditors of Paraíba and have been studying the field and practicing since then.

I also love dance (is like breathing to me), working out, outdoor activities, and the geek/pop culture.

I'm searching for new opportunities to grow and contribute in my professional area about Data Science and hope you'll considere me to a job so we can work together.

# PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
## Intern in Data Analysis - Jun 2022 to Present
Intership at Court of Auditors of Paraíba, located in João Pessoa - PB.

* Build Relational Database;
* Build dashboards for data analysis and for Auditors to consult;
* Extract, Transform and Load data (ETL) to feed dashboards and analysis reports;
* Bulid Database;
* Web Scraping scripts;
* Test Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

Contribute to analysis of public invoids (medicine and hospital material) by making SQL and QlikView scripts to feed a dashboard. Automate the extraction of data from DATASUS, from that transform and load the data into a Relational DataBase and a QlikView Dashboard.

Made a bot to collect data from instagram posts of public accounts in order to make a Natural Language Processing (NLP) of comments classifying the sentiments on posts and analyse the metrics.

Test Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to analyse description of public invoids and classify if it is about medicine or not.

# PROJECTS
### [QlikView Dashboard of State Medicine Invoids](https://github.com/mickaelyoshua7674/qlikview_dashboard_for_medicine_invoids)
From a database of public invoids at Court of Auditors of Paraíba, the data is extacted, filtered and organized through SQL scripts to feed a QlikView Dashboard. The goal is monitor the Paraíba's spendings and transactions of medicines and hospital supplies as well as companies.

### [QlikView Dashboard of Health Stablishments](https://github.com/mickaelyoshua7674/datasus_health_stablishments)
Extract, transform and Load data from the ftp server of DATASUS about helth stablishments into a Database. From that Database, feed a QlikView Dashboard with the goal of analyse the production of health stablishments and data of health professionals, an alternative way of traking their contracts and links with stablishments.

### [Instagram Bot](https://github.com/mickaelyoshua7674/insta_feed_data)
A Instagram robot using `selenium webdriver` to collect data from user posts (number of likes, publication date, text of comments, text of description, link of publishment) and get list of followers and followings.

### [Creation of medicine invoids dataset](https://github.com/mickaelyoshua7674/create_training_dataset_medicine_invoids)
From a database of public invoids at Court of Auditors of Paraíba, the data is extacted, filtered and organized through SQL scripts to build a dataset with the labels `medicine productos / hospital material / others`.

### [Comparing differents RNNs](https://github.com/mickaelyoshua7674/comparing_differents_RNNs)
Using a dataset of public invoids with labels `fuel / medicine / nan` to train diffrents types of Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM / GRU / Bidirectional / SimpleRNN) with the goal of see witch one have the best results.
